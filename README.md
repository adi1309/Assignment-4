# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Assignment


### Data:
X Var is a sensor signal taken for a sample space of 30 participants and Y Var is the corresponding response.

### Breaking Down the Code:
The code combined the training dataset and  the test dataset, and extracted partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable for each activity.

### The "NEW DATASET"
The new generated dataset contained variables calculated based on the mean and standard deviation. Each row of the dataset is an average of each activity type for all subjects.

### The code was based on the specific instructions that pertain to this assignment
Read training and test dataset into R environment.
Read variable names into R envrionment.
Read subject index into R environment.
